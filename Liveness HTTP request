In the following example, the kubelet sends the HTTP GET request to the /healthz endpoint of the application, on port 8080. If that returns a failure, then the kubelet will restart the affected container; otherwise, it would consider the application to be alive:

...
     livenessProbe:
       httpGet:
         path: /healthz
         port: 8080
         httpHeaders:
         - name: X-Custom-Header
           value: Awesome
       initialDelaySeconds: 3
       periodSeconds: 3
...
